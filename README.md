# Trillian
## General Transparency

Trillian is an implementation of the concepts described in the
[Verifiable Data Structures](docs/VerifiableDataStructures.pdf)
white paper, which in turn could be thought of as an extension and
generalisation of the ideas which underpin
[Certificate Transparency](https://certificate-transparency.org).
